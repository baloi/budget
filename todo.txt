> MONTHLY EXPENSES SHOULD BE INTEGRATED INTO WEEKLY EXPENSES,
  so WEEKLY EXPENSES should be calculated this way:

  1. How much has been accumulated for the particular expense category?
  2. When is the deadline of the expense?
  3. From this pay period until the deadline, how much per week?

> SUMMARY:
  
  Should have total cash value in checking.
  Should have a breakdown of where the money belongs.

    Example:

> Scenario: Payday and allocating money to categories
  - update total money
  - update individual categories

> Scenario pay bill/expense:
  - update total money
  - delete goals if needed (if expense is paid for)

> See goal progress:
  - subtract summary.category amount to expenses.goals.amount and all categories

> make indexes of columns for text files
